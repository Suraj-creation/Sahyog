Background  
SAHAYOG 2026 is an interdisciplinary, student-driven initiative at Vidyashilp University that invites participants to design technology-enabled, policy-aware, and human-centric solutions for one of India's most critical challenges—employment security and sustainable livelihoods in rural India.

Aligned with the national vision of Viksit Bharat, and schemes such as the Employment Guarantee Scheme – Enabling Job Security for Rural India, SAHAYOG 2026 focuses on how emerging technologies, data, and inclusive governance models can improve the effectiveness, fairness, and reach of public employment systems.

Core Problem  
Despite the existence of employment guarantee and rural livelihood schemes, fair job allocation to the right people without bias remains a persistent challenge. Issues such as incomplete or poor-quality data, lack of transparency, exclusion of vulnerable groups, low awareness of entitlements, limited skilling pathways, and ineffective communication mechanisms often prevent schemes from achieving their intended impact.

A significant section of the rural population is illiterate or semi-literate, has limited access to smartphones or digital platforms, and lacks awareness of available opportunities, grievance mechanisms, and upskilling options. As a result, job allocation can become inconsistent, delayed, biased, or disconnected from local skill potential and aspiration.

Goal  
The goal of SAHAYOG 2026 is to reimagine how employment guarantee systems can be designed and implemented in the AI era to ensure:

* Fair, unbiased, and transparent job allocation  
* Inclusion of the most deserving and vulnerable populations  
* Sustainable skill-to-employment pathways, rather than short-term work allocation

Data Collection & Intelligence

* Identifying critical data required to make minimum job guarantee schemes effective, inclusive, and responsive  
* Ethical and practical methods for data collection in low-literacy and low-connectivity environments  
* Using analytics and AI to improve eligibility assessment, skill matching, and regional demand forecasting

Fair & Bias-Free Job Allocation

* Designing transparent, auditable, and bias-minimized job allocation mechanisms  
* Ensuring gender equity, age compliance, and inclusion of marginalized communities

Communication & Outreach

* Developing effective communication strategies for populations that cannot read, write, or use digital devices  
* Exploring voice-based systems, local-language interfaces, visual communication, and community intermediaries

Upskilling & Capability Building

* Identifying skill gaps aligned with local and sector-specific employment opportunities  
* Designing accessible upskilling pathways linked to assured and dignified employment

Governance, Legal & Policy Alignment

* Ensuring compliance with legal frameworks and policy intent  
* Strengthening transparency, grievance redressal, and accountability mechanisms

Psychological Well-being & Mental Health

* Understanding the psychological impact of unemployment, irregular work, and job insecurity on rural individuals and families  
* Early identification of stress, anxiety, demotivation, and loss of aspiration linked to prolonged underemployment  
* Designing community-level, low-cost mental well-being support mechanisms integrated with employment systems  
* Incorporating behavioral insights to improve participation, trust, motivation, and sustained engagement with employment programs
